In this project I analyized an axel jump in figure skating using [Dartfish](https://www.dartfish.com/).

 <h2 style="color: teal;"> What is Included in the Analysis:</h2>
- Five still shots of different positions during the jump
- What the angle of a particular joint was during the position
- Comments regarding the different postions during the jump

Video Analyses, like the one shown above, are extremely useful for coaches to help correct athletes' form and analyze ways to improve their performances!
