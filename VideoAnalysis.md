In this project I analyized an axel jump in figure skating using Dartfish.

## What is Included in the Analysis: 
- Five still shots of different positions during the jump
- What the angle of a particular joint was during the position
- Comments regarding the different postions during the jump

## View a Gif of the Still Shots Below:
