For this project I made a maze game on Scratch! 

## How to Play‚ñ∂Ô∏è: 
- The **goal** of the game is to help the Octopus escape the maze by getting to the red exit arrow before the timer runs out
- For **Level 1** make sure to avoid the shark
- For **Level 2** make sure to avoid the shark & crab, the fish moves you closer to the exit 
- For **Level 3** make sure to avoid the jellyfish, dragon and pufferfish, the starfish moves you closer to the exit
