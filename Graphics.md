In this project I used [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to edit images. 

 <h2 style="color: teal;">Building Before and After:</h2> 

<img src="/assets/img/colorcast1.jpg" alt="Building Before" width="300"/>  <img src="/assets/img/Building.png" alt="Building After" width="300"/>

Edits I made:
- Removed the red filter
- Changed the sky by removing the previous and adding a new sky background
- Made the grass a more brighter green 

 <h2 style="color: teal;">Landscape Before and After:</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/LandscapeBefore.jpeg" alt="Landscape Before" width="300"/>  <img src="/assets/img/Landscape.png" alt="Building After" width="300"/>

Edits I made:
- Changed the sky by removing the previous and adding a new sky background
- added a bird flying in the sky, and a kayak in the water
