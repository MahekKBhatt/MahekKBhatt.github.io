In this project I used gimp to edit images. 

## Buidling Image Before:
<img src="/assets/img/colorcast1.jpg" alt="Building Before"/>
## Building Image After: 
<img src="/assets/img/Building.png" alt="Building Before"/>
## Landscape Image Before: 
<img src="/assets/img/LandscapeBefore.jpeg" alt="Building Before"/>
## Landscape Image After:
