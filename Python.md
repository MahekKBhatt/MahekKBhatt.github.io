In this project I processed a set of V̇O₂ data in Kaggle, and developed a graph. 

<img src="/assets/img/VO2Graph.png" alt="V̇O₂ Graph"/> 

Graph Features:
- Both FECO₂ and VCO₂ (y-axis) have been plotted over V̇O₂ (x-axis)
- Lines for Gas Exchange threshold (GET) and Respiratory Compensation Point (RCP)
